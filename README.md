##Java RPG Game

This is a first attempt at a 2D top-down Java game.
I am no longer working on this project as it was just a prototype.
In this project, I also managed to get (bruteforce) collision working. Since this project I have improved the efficieny of
the collision in other stuff I have been working on (/8bitsandy/jobby-5), while also keeping it as robust with no bugs!
